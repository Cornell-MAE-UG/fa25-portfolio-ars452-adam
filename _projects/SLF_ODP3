# Pre-harvesting Apparatus Client Proposal

**Team:** The Entomophiles  
**Client(s):** Cornell CALS Extension / E&J Gallo Winery / National Grape

---

## Problem Statement
Spotted lanternflies (SLF) are an invasive species that have greatly disrupted commercial grape production by aggregating on and feeding from grapevines, reducing crop quality, inhibiting ripening, and contaminating harvests.

Our main target is the removal of roughly **90% of SLF** in a single harvest/load immediately prior to harvest, in comparison with a non-treated infested vineyard.

### Success Metrics:
* **Core Sample Purity:** Fewer than 1-2 SLF remaining in a 1000g sample.
* **Weight Ratio:** SLF comprise less than 2% of the harvested weight.

### Engineering Constraints:
* **Grape Fragility:** Force must be controlled to prevent "shatter."
* **SLF Adhesion:** High-velocity fluid/air is required to break SLF grip [1].

## Impact
This product will allow grape farmers to immediately solve the issue of SLF within harvesters. This solution can be implemented without further infrastructure, allowing for rapid adoption.

## Proposed Direction: Pre-Harvest Processing

**What it is:** An apparatus mounted to the front of a harvester that removes SLF using a multi-stage water/air nozzle system before the picking head reaches the vine.

**How it would be used:**
1.  **Mount:** Attach to the harvester intake frame.
2.  **Connect:** Link to hydraulic or auxiliary power.
3.  **Operate:** System runs automatically during the harvest row.
4.  **Remove:** Modular design for easy off-season storage.

**Why it’s better than the status quo:**
* **Yield Protection:** Prevents load rejection at the winery gate.
* **Infrastructure Friendly:** Adapts to existing machinery.

## Key Risks & Unknowns
* **Incidental Harvest:** Risk of dislodging grapes.
* **Plant Pathology:** Potential damage to vine bark.
* **Fluid Saturation:** Risk of diluting grape sugar (Brix).

## Questions for the Client
1.  What is the maximum air/water pressure grapes can withstand before "shattering"?
2.  What are the mounting dimensions for the front of your standard harvesters?
3.  Do your harvesters have available hydraulic remotes or 12V/24V taps?
