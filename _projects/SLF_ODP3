# Pre-harvesting Apparatus Client Proposal
**Team:** The Entomophiles  
**Client(s):** Cornell CALS Extension / E&J Gallo Winery / National Grape

## Problem Statement
Spotted lanternflies (SLF) are an invasive species that have greatly disrupted commercial grape production by aggregating on and feeding from grapevines, reducing crop quality, inhibiting ripening, and contaminating harvests.

Our main target is the removal of roughly **90% of SLF** in a single harvest/load immediately prior to harvest.

### Success Metrics
* **Core Sample Purity:** Fewer than 1-2 SLF remaining in a 1000g sample.
* **Weight Ratio:** SLF comprise less than 2% of the total harvested weight.

### Engineering Constraints
* **Grape Fragility:** Force must be controlled to prevent "shatter" (loss of grapes).
* **SLF Adhesion:** High-velocity fluid or air is required to dislodge SLF, which can grip surfaces up to 100km/h [1].

---

## Impact
This product allows grape farmers to immediately solve the SLF issue within harvesters, allowing for more loads to be accepted without large-scale removal operations. This solution can be implemented without further infrastructure, allowing for rapid adoption.

---

## Proposed Direction: Concept A
**The Apparatus:** A multi-stage nozzle system mounted to the front of a harvester that removes SLF using water or air before the picking head reaches the vine.

### Implementation
1.  **Mounting:** Attaches to the harvester intake/front frame.
2.  **Power:** Connected to the harvester's auxiliary hydraulic or electrical systems.
3.  **Modular Design:** Allows for easy removal and storage after the harvest season.

---

## Key Risks & Unknowns
* **Incidental Harvest:** Risk of accidentally removing grapes along with SLF.
* **Plant Pathology:** High-pressure impact could damage vine bark or foliage.
* **Fluid Saturation:** Excess water could dilute grape sugar levels (Brix) or impact soil health.

---

## Questions for the Client
1.  **Shatter Threshold:** What is the maximum air or water pressure grapes can withstand before falling off the vine?
2.  **Mechanical Envelope:** What are the mounting dimensions and weight limits for your standard harvesters?
3.  **Power Access:** Do the harvesters have available hydraulic remotes or 12V/24V electrical taps?
