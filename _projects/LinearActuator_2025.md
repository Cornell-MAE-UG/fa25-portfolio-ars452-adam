The purpose of this assignment was to introduce us to a real-world applicaiton of the concepts that we are learning in class. We explored how
different mechanical systems can display different properties relative to a constant. In order to find the best possible linear actuator for our purpose,
we analyzed the most powerful actuators using a standardized equation, and desgined our frame using physical parameters.
